    "content": "In the design process, I felt a mix of excitement and nervouesness. this was due to the fact that i was working on a new project with a very open brief of what i was needing to accomplish and a tight deadline to stay on track. I think that my  research and panning phase went very well because i was able to get a good understanding of where i think i should take this project early on and i was able to accomplish my sprint goal of getting the work done early leaving more time for my interviews. I think that my brainstorming didnt go the best because I found it hard to come up with ideas that i was happy with and i think that this was due to the fact that i was trying to do too much at once. I think that i can improve on this by taking a step back and looking at what the target audience would need to help solve their problems. I think for my next sprint i will spend more time on trying to empathise with what the target audience would need and how they could be benefitted through this problem."

    "content": "I think that this week my interviews went very well because i was able to get a good understanding and insights of what real young people are experiencing in their lives. and this information that i recieved backed up my research and planning phase. I felt very comfortable in this phase because all of the information that i was able to gather from my interviews was very helpful and i was able to get a good understanding of what the target audience would need. I think that creation of my solution didnt go that wel because i was finidng it hard to try and decipher a way to make it unique and different from what is already out there. I think that this is due to trying to enter a already saturated market with my issue and solution. Next time i believe that i can improve on this by taking a step back and spending more time on planning a solution that can be different from the rest in a new and exciting way well still being realistic and helpfull to the target audience. for the next sprint i will be focusing on my proof of concept and trying to get a good understanding of how each core idea will be working."

    "author": "Corey Horgan",
    "content": "I believe that this week I made good progress in shaping my brands identity, lo-fi prototyping and Proof of concepts. I explored a wide range of visual directions and came to a conclusion that i believe will best fit within my target audiences preferances. I chose a visual direction that aims to feel more fun and engaging. some parts of this process was very overwhelming and i didnt know where to start but I think the main thing that i struggled with was the proof of concept because i had never heard of this before and was very confused with how to approach somehting like this with not a lot of knowledge on how to show that proof of concept off without the tools yet to make it. I think that i need to research into how to make my proof of concepts more viable before i start this process next time because it would take a lot less stress off my shoulders and give me more time to work on my project and spend less time overthinking the small things. For my next sprint im going spend more time planning the things i struggle with early so i can have a deeper understanding on how to complete them leaving more time for other tasks in my project."

    "author": "Corey Horgan",
    "content": "This week I believe that i did quite well on the creation of my design strategy document because of the clear planning that i had for the document early on. I also think that that the completion of the brand visual direction went quite well because of the creation of things like the illustrations and logo giving me a clear idea of how this will look and where i can go next. I think that my pitch presentation didnt go very well because I didnt understand what information to include in my slides, aswell as me not being the most confident speaker i missed a lot of what i was meant to say. this made me appear very behind with my idea and not too much of a clear idea on where i could head next. The feedback that i recieved on my brand on how to present was very beneficial and i will hopefully be able to implement it into my next presentation. For my next sprint i will be focusing on the creation of my wireframes and will be spending more time on planning the things i stuggle with early"

    "content": "This week I believe that my creation of my wireframes went quite well because I focused on the flows that have a greater impact on what the site is and how it works rather then wasting my time on building all avenues that exist on the app. I also belive that the creation of my brand guidelines went quite well because of the clear visual direction that i had in mind and the ability to show it in a clear way. The things that didnt go well was the creation of the style guide. This was because of procrastination and me not knoing where to start on the creation of one. this week i have learnt what a style guide is and how it can be used in a companys branding. For the next sprint i will be making the Hi-fi prototype of a mobile app and the website."
